### Jetson Nano Technical Development Series Related to VAIRC
This series introduces the technical development related to VAIRC on Jetson Nano.\
The first topic is "Inference of Pre-trained Models on Jetson Nano," which introduces training an MNIST handwritten digit recognition model on an external computing device, converting it, and then importing it into Jetson for inference.\
This serves as technical preparation for the next topic.\
The second topic is the fine-tuning of pre-trained models. VAIRC often uses pre-trained models.

### VAIRC相关的Jetson nano的技术开发专题
本专题系列为介绍VAIRC相关的Jetson nano的技术开发技术。\
专题1为“预训练模型在Jetson nano上推理”，介绍在外部计算设备上训练一个MNIST手写数字的识别模型，经变换后导入到Jetson进行识别推理。\
这是为下一专题做技术准备。\
专题2为预训练模型的微调。VAIRC经常会使用预训练模型。
